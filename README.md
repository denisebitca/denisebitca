### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

## Disclaimer

I barely use Github. It's here for archiving previous projects, contributing to Github projects and because every third job application asks me for my Github page.
Most of what I do is over at [my Miaoute + Gitea profile](https://git.4201337.xyz/denise) or [the Miaoute + Gitea Miaoute profile](https://git.4201337.xyz/miaoute)
